">>" is the signed right shift operator. It shifts a bit pattern to the right. The bit pattern is given by the left-hand operand, and the number of positions to shift by the right-hand operand.

When you shift right two bits, you drop the two least significant bits.

Let’s say, x = 00111011

So when you do, x >> 2, it results in x = 00001110
